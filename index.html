                  <p><strong>Opera Software, </strong>Devices Developer Intern</p>
                  <p>
                    I worked on integrating the Opera webbrowser with a media API on an embedded Linux platform.
                    In addition to writing code to interface with the decode and output APIs of the platform the work included
                    parsing and remuxing of various media formats and synchronization of audio and video playback.<br>

                  <p>
                    I worked on the core browser engine focusing mainly on the DOM and layout parts.
                    This included implementation of various HTML5 features, implementation of web performance APIs
                    and general bugfixing.
                    Through this work I gained great experience in the HTML and DOM Core standards.<br>

                    I developed a simple Android application for the Swedish translation website <a href=http://tyda.se>tyda.se</a><br>

                      AFP (Apple Filing Protocol) is a Network file system similar to SMB developed by Apple.
                      My project was to implement a backend for the virtual file system GVFS to support AFP-volumes.
                      The work mainly consisted of network programming and implementation of the AFP protocol.
                      The result of my project is integrated into <a href=http://gnome.org>GNOME</a> since version 3.2.<br>

                    GStreamer is an open source plugin based multimedia framework used on a range of different devices.
                    My work consisted of writing a plugin to GStreamer to utilize the hardware-decoder found in newer NVIDIA GPUs.
                    Except GStreamer/Glib programming the work also included bit stream parsing of different video formats such as H264 and MPEG-4.<br>

                  I'm a final year student at Linköping University, Sweden, pursuing a Master in Computer Science and Engineering.
                  Apart from schoolwork I like to immerse myself in different development projects and I am always trying to learn something new. 
                  Some of my projects and open source work is to be found at <a href="https://github.com/c-a">GitHub</a>.
